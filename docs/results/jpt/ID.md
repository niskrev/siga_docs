Notes:

* the _weighted information gains_ show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a $\%$ of the total information about a given shock.
* the _information gains_ show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a $\%$ of the total variance originating from **that** frequency band.
* the _weights_ are given by variance originating in a given frequency band as a $\%$ of the total variance of the shock
* in this model the information gains are $100\%$, therefore the weighted gains simply replicate the weights.
