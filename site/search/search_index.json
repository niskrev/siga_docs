To that end, the author estimates a standard small-scale New-Keynesian model with price stickiness and habit formation, augmented with seven structural shocks. Full details about the model can be found in the original publication. Here I only describe those of its features that are directly relevant for the analysis which follows. Firstly, three of the shocks are to monetary policy, which is described by the following policy rule: $$ \\frac{1+I_t}{\\Gamma_t} = \\left[A \\left(\\frac{1 + \\Pi_t}{\\Gamma_t} \\right)^{\\alpha_t} \\left(\\frac{Y_t}{X_t} \\right)^{\\alpha_{y}} \\right]^{1-\\gamma_I} \\left(\\frac{1 + I_{t-1}}{\\Gamma_{t-1}} \\right)^{\\gamma_I} e^{z_t^{m}}, $$ where \\(I_t\\) the nominal interest rate, \\(Y_t\\) is aggregate output, \\(\\Pi_t\\) is the inflation rate, \\(\\Gamma_t\\) is the inflation-target, \\(X_t\\) is a nonstationary productivity shocks, and \\(z_t^{m}\\) is a stationary interest-rate shock. The inflation target is defined as $$ \\Gamma_t = X_t^m e^{z_t^{m2}}, $$ where \\(X_t^m\\) and \\(z_t^{m2}\\) are permanent and transitory components of the inflation target. It is assumes that \\(X_t^m\\) and \\(X_t\\) grow at a rates \\(g^m_t\\) and \\(g_t\\) , respectively. There are two preference shocks affecting the lifetime utility function of the representative household, given by $$ \\E_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t e^{\\xi_t}\\Bigg{ \\frac{\\left[\\left(C_t - \\delta \\tilde{C}_{t-1}\\right) \\left(1-e^{\\theta_t}h_t \\right)^{\\chi} \\right]^{1-\\sigma} - 1}{1-\\sigma} \\Bigg}, $$ where \\(C_t\\) is consumption, \\(\\tilde{C}_t\\) is the cross sectional average of consumption, \\(h_t\\) is hours worked, \\(\\xi_t\\) is an intertemporal preference shock, and \\(\\theta_t\\) is a shock to labor supply. In addition to \\(X_t\\) , there is also a stationary productivity shock \\(z_t\\) , which affects the production technology according to $$ Y_t = e^{z_t}X_t h_t^{\\alpha}, $$ The five stationary shocks ( \\(\\xi_t\\) , \\(\\theta_t\\) , \\(z_t\\) , \\(z_t^{m}\\) , and \\(z_t^{m2}\\) ) and the growth rates of the two non-stationary shocks ( \\(g_t\\) and \\(g^m_t\\) ) are all assumed to follow first-order autoregressive processes. Uribe (2021) estimates the model using quarterly US data on three variables: per capita output growth ( \\(\\triangle y_t\\) ), the interest-rate-inflation differential ( \\(r_t=i_t - \\pi_t\\) ), and the change in the nominal interest rate ( \\(\\triangle i_t\\) ). All variables are assumed to be observed with measurement errors. Thus, there are ten independent sources of randomness in the data and only three observables. Clearly, not all, if any, of the latent variables can be recovered fully. The purpose of the remainder of this section is to determine how well each structural shock can be recovered and where in the spectrum most of the information comes from, as well as what are the information contributions of different observed variables overall and across different frequency bands.","title":"Note"},{"location":"results/jpt/IC.html","text":"","title":"Information complementarity"},{"location":"results/jpt/ID.html","text":"Information decomposition Notes: the weighted information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total information about a given shock. the information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance originating from that frequency band. the weights are given by variance originating in a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance of the shock in this model the information gains are \\(100\\%\\) , therefore the weighted gains simply replicate the weights.

To that end, and expanding on their previous work in JPT (2010), they estimate a New Keynesian model featuring imperfectly competitive goods and labor markets, as well as different nominal and real frictions such as sticky prices and wages, habit formation in consumption, variable capital utilization and investment adjustment costs. The model has eight structural shocks in total, with three technology shocks, two of which are related to investment. Specifically, JPT distinguish between final and intermediate consumption, investment, and capital goods, each being produced in a different sector. They introduce a shock that affects the transformation of consumption into investment goods, and another shock that affects the transformation of investment goods into productive capital. The first, called investment-specific technology (IST) shock, is introduced via the production function in the investment good producing sector: \\[ I_t = \\Upsilon_t Y_t^I, \\] where \\(I_t\\) is the quantity of investment goods in efficiency units produced with \\(Y_t^I\\) units of the final good. \\(\\Upsilon_t\\) represents the IST and is assumed to be a non-stationary random process growing at a rate \\(\\upsilon_t\\) . The second investment technology shock is introduced via the production technology in the capital good producing sector, which assumes that new capital, denoted with \\(i_t\\) , is produced from investment goods according to \\[ i_t = \\mu_t \\left(1 - S\\left( \\frac{I_t}{I_{t-1}}\\right)\\right) \\] where \\(S\\) is an investment adjustment cost function, and \\(\\mu_t\\) is a stationary shock to the marginal efficiency of investment (MEI), assumed to be an AR(1) process. The third technology shocks affects the production functions in the intermediate good producing sector according to: \\[ Y_t(i) = \\max \\{ A_t^{1-\\alpha} K_t(i)^{\\alpha} L_t(i)^{1-\\alpha} - A_t \\Upsilon_t^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}} F; 0 \\} \\] where \\(Y_t(i)\\) , \\(K_t(i)\\) , and \\(L_t(i)\\) are the quantities of output produced, and effective capital and labor employed by intermediate good producer \\(i\\) . \\(F\\) represents fixed cost of production, and \\(A_t\\) is a common non-stationary neutral technology process, growing at rate \\(z_t\\) . The final consumption good \\(Y_t\\) is produced by combining a continuum of intermediate goods, according to \\[ Y_t = \\left[ \\int_{0}^{1} Y_t(i)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\lambda_{p,t}}} \\right]^{1+\\lambda_{p,t}} \\] where \\(\\lambda_{p,t}\\) is a stationary price markup shock following ARMA(1,1) process. Similarly to the model in the previous section, there is a shock to the intertemporal preferences of the households populating the economy whose lifetime utility function is given by \\[ \\operatorname{E}_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t b_{t}\\Bigg\\{ \\log\\left(C_t - h C_{t-1}\\right) - \\varphi \\frac{L_t(j)^{1+\\nu}}{1+\\nu} \\Bigg\\}, \\] where \\(C_t\\) is consumption, \\(b_t\\) is the stationary intertemporal preference shock, assumed to follow an AR(1) process. JPT assume that there is a continuum of households \\(j\\in[0,1]\\) , each one being a supplier of specialized labor denoted by \\(L_t(j)\\) . The specialized labor in turn is combined into homogenous labor input according to \\[ L_t = \\left[ \\int_{0}^{1} L_t(i)^{\\frac{1}{1+\\lambda_{w,t}}} \\right]^{1+\\lambda_{w,t}} \\] where \\(\\lambda_{w,t}\\) is a stationary wage markup shock assumed to follow an ARMA(1,1) process. The last two shocks are to government fiscal and monetary policy. Public spending \\(G_t\\) is a time-varying fraction of output, \\[ G_t = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{g_t} \\right) Y_t \\] where the government spending shock \\(g_{t}\\) as a stationary AR(1) process. Monetary policy consists of setting the nominal interest rate \\(R_t\\) according to the following policy rule: \\[ \\frac{R_t}{R} = \\left( \\frac{R_{t-1}}{R} \\right)^{\\rho_R} \\left[\\left( \\frac{\\pi_{t}}{\\pi}\\right)^{\\phi_{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{X_{t}}{X_t^{\\ast}}\\right)^{\\phi_{X}} \\right]^{1-\\rho_R} \\left[\\frac{X_t/X_{t-1}}{X^{\\ast}_t/X^{\\ast}_{t-1}} \\right]^{\\phi_{dX}} \\varepsilon_{mp,t}, \\] where \\(e_{mp,t}\\) is the monetary policy shock, \\(R\\) is the steady state of the nominal rate, \\(\\pi_t\\) is the inflation rate, \\(X_t=C_t+I_t+G_t\\) is actual real GDP and \\(X_t^{\\ast}\\) is the level of GDP under flexible prices and wages and in the absence of markup shocks. To summarize, there are eight shocks in the model, six stationary and two non-stationary. Two of the stationary shocks -- to price and wage markups, follow ARMA(1,1) processes, and one -- to monetary policy, is an i.i.d process. The remaining stationary shocks -- to government spending, MEI, and intertemporal preferences, as well as the growth rates of the two non-stationary shocks -- to IST and neutral technology, follow AR(1) processes. The disturbances to all shocks are assumed to be Gaussian, leading to a linear Gaussian state space representation of the solution of log-linear approximation of model. JPT estimate the model using US data on hours worked ( \\(h_t=\\log L_t\\) ), inflation ( \\(\\pi_t\\) ), the nominal interest rate ( \\(R_t\\) ), and the growth rates of GDP ( \\(x_t= \\triangle \\log X_t\\) ), consumption ( \\(c_t= \\triangle \\log C_t\\) ), investment ( \\(i_t= \\triangle \\log I_t\\) ), real wages ( \\(w_t=\\triangle \\log \\frac{W_t}{P_t}\\) ), and the relative price of investment ( \\(\\pi^i_t=\\triangle \\log \\frac{P_{It}}{P_t}\\) ). Unlike Uribe (2021), they do not allow for measurement errors in any of the series.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"results/uribe/IC.html","text":"","title":"Information complementarity"},{"location":"results/uribe/ID.html","text":"Information decomposition Notes: the weighted information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total information about a given shock. the information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance originating from that frequency band. the weights are given by variance originating in a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance of the shock Information contributions Most informative variables","title":"Information decompositions"},{"location":"results/uribe/ID.html#information-decomposition","text":"Notes: the weighted information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total information about a given shock. the information gains show the amount of information from a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance originating from that frequency band. the weights are given by variance originating in a given frequency band as a \\(\\%\\) of the total variance of the shock","title":"Information decomposition"},{"location":"results/uribe/ID.html#information-contributions","text":"","title":"Information contributions"},{"location":"results/uribe/ID.html#most-informative-variables","text":"","title":"Most informative variables"},{"location":"results/uribe/VD.html","text":"","title":"Variance decomositions"},{"location":"results/uribe/uribe.html","text":"Uribe (2021) investigates the nature and empirical importance of monetary policy shocks that produce neo-Fisherian dynamics, i.e. move interest rates and inflation in the same direction over the short run.
